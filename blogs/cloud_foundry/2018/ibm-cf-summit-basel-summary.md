# IBM’s Contributions to CF Summit 2018 in Basel, Switzerland

## History of IBM’s contributions

IBM has had one of the longest and sustain set of contributions to previous CF-Summits. And this year, for the one that is coming up in October 10-11 in Basel, Switzerland it will be no different.

From talks to give updates on incubating projects, to overview updates on existing projects, and to panels, IBMers will be all over the floor on the ground at Basel. This will also include our booth where I invite you to stop by daily to talk to IBMers and get an overview of our recent products and services.

In this recap I highlights these various talks and give you links to the official agenda so you can plan your time and meet the folks in the trenches who are helping move the platform forward.

## This Year at CF-Summit

At this year’s European summit in Basel we have 10 talks, one panel, and two keynotes. And we will also be sponsoring the hackathon and help run it again as we have done the past three years.

### [Hackathon](http://sched.co/FY0F)

Last year we had the winning team for the CF hackathon. A team of three IBMers worked non-stop for 24 hours to create what was a first of a kind service broker for Ethereum smart contracts.

The Blockhead project, now incubating in the CF-Extensions PMC, allows smart contracts developers to quickly get their contracts  compiled and up and running on the cloud.

The broker is compliant with the Open Service Broker API which means it can be used on Cloud Foundry but also on other compliant platforms, e.g., Kubernetes. 

### [Talks](https://www.cloudfoundry.org/event_subpages/cfeu-2018-schedule/)

The same [Blockhead team also has a talk at the conference](http://sched.co/FRyj) and will be getting into the details of the latest version of the blockchain service broker. For instance, they have been busy since being accepted in the CF-Extensions to rewrite part of Blockhead to be more scalable and extensible.

Second, one of the most exciting projects from Boston’s summit was the Eirini project which aims to allow a pluggable backend for Cloud Foundry. Led by IBM’s Julian Friedman and developers mostly in Europe, the team, including Julian Skupnjak of IBM is getting ready to make the latest version of Eirini not only demoable but perhaps available for all to try. Come to their [“Kube Your Enthusiasm”](http://sched.co/FRy8) talk for the latest and see their roadmap.

Another extenal technology that has increasingly become important in Cloud Foundry is Istio. The CF networking teams have started adding Istio/Envoy to the platform and are looking at various places where Istio technology could complement or extend the current platform. IBMer Christopher Luciano, long time engineer in the Istio ecosystem will be co-leading, with Pivotal’s Shannon Coen, a [birds of feather discussion](http://sched.co/FRyc) about Istio and where it’s heading and used in Cloud Foundry. 

Besides various introductions to three tracks led by IBMers, other talks span the various technologies used in Cloud Foundry. A good sample includes:

1. Surya V Duggirala of IBM will discuss his [deep experience running containers](http://sched.co/FRyE) applications and contributing to various container ecosystems.
2. Another container-specific talk is by Sandy Cash of IBM and colleague from SUSE Troy Topnik discussing what it takes to get [Cloud Foundry installed and running as a containerized workload](http://sched.co/FRyA).
3. Lucinio Santos and Car Swanson of IBM will share their [experiences administrating Cloud Foundry in the enterprise](http://sched.co/FRyW). This includes using Design Thinking methodology to plan capacity, scaling, and other obstacles that typically occurs when large enterprises adopt cloud.
4. Bo Yang of IBM and Rohit Sharma of SAP give an update on the [App AutoScaler project](http://sched.co/FRym) which gives a flexible service broker for scaling your applications in any Cloud Foundry installation.
5. An update of the [Open Service Broker API specification and direction](http://sched.co/FW1v) by IBM’s Doug Davis.
6. An update from IBMers Peter Goetz and Norman Sutorius on the [Bits-Service](http://sched.co/FRyP) runtime component which was developed and led by IBM Germany lab.
7. Yours truly on the [Kubernetes Cloud Provider Interface](http://sched.co/GATe) experimental project which can be used to deploy and manage CF on top of a Kubernetes clusters.

Many of these talks will include live demos and discussions of future directions. I encourage you to come ready to engage the presenting IBMers with your questions and comments.

### Panels

In a redux of the panel they did last summit entitled: [“Cloud Foundry and Kubernentes - Did it blend?”](http://sched.co/FRyD), IBM lead developer for the IBM Application Services, Simon Moser will again join SAP colleague Bernd Krannich as well as panelists Jeff Hobbs (SUSE), Chris Crall (Google), Ulrich Homann (Microsoft), Cornelia Davis (Pivotal), and Swarna Podila (CFF) will discuss Cloud Foundry’s direction with respect to Kubernetes and how these two worlds are colliding more and more every day.

### Keynotes

IBMers are set to have two keynotes in Basel. First, Nima Kaviani and Swetha Repakula will be on stage with CF CTO Chip Childers for a live [demonstration of their Blockhead project](http://sched.co/Fq4A). Also, IBM will have one of the main keynotes for the conference—details to be announced.

## Conclusion

While the overall numbers of IBMers involved full time in Cloud Foundry has decreased from its hey days two years ago, the productivity of IBMers at the summit has not decreased. We remain committed to the platform as you can see from the list of activities listed. 

And as a participants in many other open source platforms and various other cloud projects, we are taking charge and leading the integration of various technologies (where it makes sense) to provide the best resulting experience to our IBM Cloud customers and to all who are invested in these open source projects.
