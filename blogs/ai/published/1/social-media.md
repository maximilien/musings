New post on AI Musings: "AI Coding Assistants"

After a year of daily use across Cursor, Claude Code, TRAE, Amp, and others, I've found two paradigms dominate: IDE-integrated and terminal-native. Each has strengths; all face the same fundamental challenge—context window limitations.

Key takeaways:
• 85% of developers now use AI coding tools regularly, with 41% of code AI-generated or assisted
• Claude Code's terminal-native approach has been revelatory for my workflow—speed and multi-file operations that feel natural
• TRAE's built-in browser solves a real friction point for UI work (though ByteDance ownership raises privacy questions)
• Testing discipline is non-negotiable—agents move fast, tests catch regressions

The productivity gains are real (50-80% for me). But so is the need for review discipline and context management strategies.

New AI Musings post: "AI Coding Assistants"

After a year testing Cursor, Claude Code, TRAE, Amp & others daily:

Two paradigms: IDE-integrated vs terminal-native
One constraint: context windows

85% of devs use these tools. 41% of code is AI-assisted.

My take: 50-80% productivity gains—but testing discipline is non-negotiable.
