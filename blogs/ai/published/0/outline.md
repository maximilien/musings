Introducing "AI Musings"

Target length: ~1500 words (shorter intro post)

Abstract
* AI is transforming technology at an unprecedented pace — we need thoughtful voices to make sense of it
* This Substack offers a unique perspective: 30 years of industry experience, PhD in AI Agents, and Bay Area immersion
* Commitment: at least two posts per month, every two weeks, with a mix of planned topics and current events
* Do we need another AI newsletter? Perhaps not — but we need more practitioner’s perspectives
* Goal: accessible but educated analysis from someone actively building in the space
* Join me as I share what I'm learning as a new founder navigating the AI revolution

Introduction
* The question everyone asks: "Do we really need another AI newsletter?"
* My answer: we need more builder perspectives, not just analyst takes
* After 30 years working for BIG tech decided to retire early and become a founder of an AI Agents startup — going back to my root as my PhD’s topic was on agents
* What makes this different: 30 years in tech, now a first-time founder

Brief Biography
* IBM and IBM Research career:
    * Decades of experience at one of the world's leading research institutions
    * Work on pioneering technologies that shaped modern computing
    * Specific highlights: cloud computing, containers, social networking. I was one of the leaders creating early versions of what became the IBM Cloud — via Cloud Foundry and Bluemix
* Academic foundation:
    * PhD in Computer Science (2005) — 20 years ago
    * Dissertation focused on AI Agents — prescient given today's landscape
    * The long arc from academic research to mainstream adoption
* Current chapter:
    * Founder and CEO of stealth AI/Agents startup
    * Applying decades of learning to building something new
    * The unique challenges and joys of being a first-time founder

Bay Area Uniqueness
* Twenty years living and working in the Bay Area
* Witnessed the rise and fall of multiple technology waves
