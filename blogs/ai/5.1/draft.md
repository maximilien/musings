**TL;DR:** OpenClaw is a powerful framework for building autonomous AI agents. But managing 10, 50, or 100s agents? That's where things get messy. I built ClawMax to solve this—adding visual management, organizational structure, workflow automation, and templates on top of OpenClaw's foundation. This post explains what it is, why I built it, how I am using it, and what I learned.

---

Managing 100s AI agents isn't like managing a team of 10 people. It's worse.

Individual agents are easy. You give them an identity, some skills, a workspace. They do their job. But when you scale to dozens or hundreds? Chaos. Which agents are online? Who's working on what? Who's performing well? Who needs to be updated (additional prompts, context, etc)? How do you coordinate them? Where's the execution history? 

I've been using OpenClaw for weeks now—managing agent teams for research, development workflows, and community coordination. OpenClaw is an incredible foundation: file-based workspaces, extensible skills, WebSocket communication, persistent memory. But it's mainly built for individual agents, not teams.

So I built ClawMax. The orchestration layer OpenClaw needed.

---

## The OpenClaw Foundation

### What is OpenClaw?

OpenClaw is an open-source framework for building autonomous AI agents. It's become one of the fastest-growing OSS AI agent projects, with a powerful foundation:

- **Identity**: Each agent has a unique identity, "soul", role, and persistent workspace
- **Skills**: Extensible skill system (GitHub, Slack, WhatsApp, 1Password, and more)
- **Memory**: File-based agent memory using markdown documents
- **Communication**: Real-time WebSocket gateway for agent interaction
- **Tools**: Rich CLI for agent management and orchestration

### The Problems I Hit

After a few days running 15+ agents, the cracks showed:

**Visibility crisis**: Opening 15 terminal windows to check agent status?
**Organization chaos**: Agents scattered across directories. No sense of team structure.
**Coordination nightmare**: Manually messaging each agent when I wanted a team response? Tedious.
**No execution history**: "Did that agent execute its tasks yesterday?" *checks various log files*
**Template hell**: Cloning a successful agent meant copying files and fixing paths manually.

The CLI is great for one agent. Terrible for 100.

### What I Built

ClawMax adds five layers on top of OpenClaw:

1. **Visual Dashboard**: See all agents, their status, and recent activity—one page
2. **Organizations**: Structure agents into communities and groups (like Slack channels)
3. **Workflows**: Send tasks to agent teams with scheduling (cron-style automation)
4. **Templates**: Export/import agents and entire org structures—one click
5. **Execution Tracking**: Watch workflows run in real-time, see agent responses, review history

The result? Managing 100 agents feels like managing 10.

## Architecture: Building ON OpenClaw

### Design Philosophy

ClawMax is designed to **enhance** OpenClaw, not replace it:

- ✅ Works with existing OpenClaw workspaces (no migration needed)
- ✅ No agent modifications required (uses standard gateway API)
- ✅ Leverages OpenClaw CLI for workflow execution
- ✅ File-based compatibility (reads/writes workspace files)
- ✅ Fail-safe operation (agents work independently if dashboard down)
- ✅ Multiple workspaces with different directories
- ✅ Run your agents, workflows, communication, create your templates with git backend (persisting the files)

### Technical Stack

![ClawMax - architecture stack](images/architecture-diagram.svg)

### Key Integration Points

1. **Workspace Files**: Direct read/write to `~/.openclaw/workspace/`
2. **Gateway RPC**: WebSocket communication via `chat.send` method
3. **CLI Integration**: Spawns `openclaw workflow run` for orchestration
4. **Future**: Token tracking via OpenClaw's `sessions.usage` API (pending Gateway scope support)

---

## Core Features

### 1. Multi-Agent Dashboard 🎛️

**Visual overview of your entire agent ecosystem**

![ClawMax - dashboard with agent cards](images/image1-dashboard.png)

**Features**:
- Real-time online/offline status via gateway detection
- Auto-restart (wake up) agents by simply chatting with them
- Agent cards showing identity, skills, communities, tags
- Activity timeline across all agents
- Filter by status, communities, groups, or tags
- Grid, list, and table views with persistent preferences

**Agent Actions**:
- **Add Skills**: Assign GitHub, Slack, WhatsApp, or custom skills with one click
- **Chat Directly**: Message agents via their group channels
- **Clone & Template**: Copy and save successful agents as reusable templates
- **Edit Files**: Modify IDENTITY.md, SOUL.md, TOOLS.md directly in dashboard
- **AI-Assisted Creation**: Create new agents from simple descriptions:
  ```
  "QA engineer that monitors CI/CD, reviews PRs,
  and ensures all tests pass before merge"
  ```

**Planned Features** ⏳:
- Token usage monitoring (requires OpenClaw Gateway RPC updates)
- Agent health metrics and uptime tracking
- Hover tooltip with full details

**Value**: Replace terminal chaos with a mission control center. Know at a glance which agents are active and what they're working on.

---

### 2. Organizational Structure 🏢

**Logical grouping of agents for coordination**

![ClawMax - organizations page with hierarchy](images/image2-organizations.png)

**Concepts**:
- **Communities**: Departments or large groups (Engineering, Product, Customer Success)
- **Groups**: Cross-functional teams (Daily Standup, Security Team, Onboarding)
- **Tags**: Flexible labels for organizing and targeting (engineer, manager, security, qa)
  - First tag becomes the **primary tag** for quick filtering and organization

**Navigation Features**:
- Click community/group names to jump directly to their chat in Communication page
- 💬 Chat icons for quick access to group conversations
- Visual hierarchy showing community → groups → agents
- Agent membership badges and counts

**Features**:
- Flexible membership (agents can be in multiple groups)
- Workflow targeting based on organizational structure
- Import/export organization templates

**Value**: Scale from 5 to 500 agents with clear organizational structure.

---

### 3. Workflow Automation 🔄

**Scheduled or manual multi-agent coordination**

![ClawMax - workflow execution in progress](images/image3-workflow.png)

**Anatomy of a Workflow**:
```yaml
---
id: daily-standup
name: Daily Standup
schedule: "0 9 * * 1-5"  # Every weekday 9 AM
enabled: true
targeting:
  communities: [Engineering Team]
  groups: []
  tags: [engineer]
  agents: []
executionMode: automated
---

# Daily Standup Instructions
Please provide your daily standup update:
- What did you accomplish yesterday?
- What are you working on today?
- Any blockers?
```

**Workflow Design Philosophy**:
Workflows follow OpenClaw's file-based approach—written in plain English like prompts. They can reference tags, communities, and roles, letting agents independently interpret their responsibilities based on their identity. No rigid code structures. Just natural language instructions. Just as you would do with a team of humans.

**Execution Flow (simplified)**:

![ClawMax - workflow execution flow](images/workflow-execution-flow.svg)

1. Schedule triggers (cron) OR manual button click
2. Dashboard resolves target agents by community/group/tag
3. Creates execution record with participant list
4. Spawns `openclaw workflow run <id>`
5. CLI connects to each agent's gateway via WebSocket
6. Sends workflow content via `chat.send` RPC
7. Captures agent responses in execution JSON
8. Dashboard polls for updates every 5 seconds

**Execution Features**:
- **Completion Toasts**: Get notified when workflows finish with success/failure counts
- **Smart Sorting**: Running executions always appear first in the list
- **Auto-refresh**: Selected workflow details refresh when execution completes
- **Archive**: archive and access old execution

**Value**: Coordinate 50 agents with a single click. No manual message sending required.
