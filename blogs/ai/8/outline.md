8. On the Importance of Reading

Target length: ~2000 words

Abstract
* In an age of AI-generated summaries and instant answers, deep reading remains essential
* Reading builds mental models, nuanced understanding, and creative capacity that AI cannot shortcut
* This is especially important for technology practitioners who must understand complex systems
* The paradox: AI makes information more accessible but deep understanding requires slow reading
* Types of reading: skimming, scanning, deep reading — each has its place
* A call to protect and cultivate reading as a core professional and personal practice

Introduction
* Observation: how reading habits have changed in the AI era
* The temptation to "just ask Claude" instead of reading documentation/papers/books
* [Personal anecdote about reading and its impact on your work]
* Why this matters more, not less, in 2025

What Reading Does That AI Summaries Cannot
* Building mental models through extended engagement
* Encountering ideas in context, with nuance and qualification
* The serendipity of unexpected connections
* Developing patience and attention span
* Understanding author's reasoning, not just conclusions
* Exposure to writing styles that improve your own communication
* The irreplaceable experience of following a complex argument
* [Research: cognitive science on reading vs information retrieval]

Types of Reading and When to Use Each
* Skimming: Getting the lay of the land, deciding what deserves deeper attention
    * Good for: news, documentation overviews, initial research
    * Tools: RSS readers, Pocket, AI summaries as previews
* Scanning: Finding specific information efficiently
    * Good for: reference material, troubleshooting, fact-checking
    * Tools: search, AI Q&A, indexes
* Deep Reading: Extended engagement with complex material
    * Good for: foundational texts, complex papers, books that shape thinking
    * Requires: time, focus, note-taking, re-reading
    * Cannot be shortcut or delegated to AI

Reading in Technology Practice
* Reading documentation: the undervalued skill
    * Most developers don't read docs thoroughly
    * AI can help navigate docs but can't replace understanding them
* Reading code: arguably the most important form of reading for developers
    * AI can explain code but reading it yourself builds intuition
    * Pattern recognition comes from exposure, not summaries
* Reading papers: staying current with research
    * Abstracts and summaries miss methodology and limitations
    * Critical reading skills essential for evaluating AI claims
* Reading books: long-form understanding of domains
    * Technology books for deep domain knowledge
    * Non-technology books for cross-pollination and creativity

The Reading-Writing Connection
* Reading improves writing, which improves thinking
* Writers read voraciously — the input-output relationship
* AI can generate text but understanding what makes good writing requires reading
* Technical writing specifically benefits from reading good technical writing
* Documentation quality correlates with how much documentation someone has read

Building a Reading Practice
* Time: Scheduling reading vs finding time
    * Morning reading rituals
    * Commute/travel as reading time
    * Reducing screen time in favor of reading time
* Selection: What deserves your reading attention
    * Primary sources over summaries
    * Classics in your field
    * Outside your comfort zone
* Method: Active reading practices
    * Note-taking and annotation
    * Discussing what you read
    * Writing about what you read (blogs!)
* Tools: Supporting deep reading
    * E-readers vs physical books
    * Read-later services
    * Reference management

Reading in the AI Era: A Balanced Approach
* Use AI to find what to read, not to replace reading
* Use AI summaries as previews, not substitutes
* Use AI to help understand difficult passages, then read the original
* The goal: AI augments your reading capacity, doesn't replace it
* Risk: AI enables reading avoidance that feels productive
* Discipline: knowing when to ask AI and when to read yourself

Recommended Reading (Meta!)
* Your reading list for 2025
* Books that shaped your thinking
* Papers that changed your approach
* How to find good things to read
* Communities and newsletters that surface quality content
* The value of re-reading classics

Conclusion
* Reading is a competitive advantage as others outsource it to AI
* Deep understanding comes from deep engagement, no shortcuts
* The best AI practitioners are also the best readers
* Challenge: commit to reading one foundational book per month
* The investment in reading pays compound returns over a career
* In a world of infinite AI-generated content, curated, quality reading matters more than ever
