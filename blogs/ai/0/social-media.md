After 30 years at IBM, I did something terrifying.

I left to build an AI Agents startup—returning to my PhD roots in multiagent systems from 20 years ago.

Now I'm sharing what I'm learning from the "trenches" in a new Substack: **AI Musings**

What to expect:
→ Practitioner insights on AI agents, coding assistants, and infrastructure
→ Honest tool comparisons (Cursor vs Claude Code vs TRAE—I have opinions)
→ The human side of tech: meetups, reading, maintaining perspective

No corporate voice. No sponsored takes. Just a builder's perspective after decades of shipping platforms (Cloud Foundry, Knative, 100+ papers, 20 patents).

First up: AI Coding Assistants—the tools that changed how I work, and the ones that didn't live up to the hype.
