# Introducing "AI Musings"

*A new Substack on AI Agents, technology, and the builder's perspective*

**TL;DR:** After 30 years at IBM (Distinguished Engineer, Cloud Foundry architect, Knative lead, 100+ papers, 20 patents), I left to build an AI Agents startup—returning to my PhD roots in multiagent systems.

AI Musings is my builder's perspective on the AI revolution: practical insights on agents, coding assistants, and infrastructure; honest tool comparisons; and thoughts on the human side of tech.

Two posts per month. No corporate voice. No sponsored takes.

Up next: AI coding assistants, vector search, and lessons from running the AI Agents Meetup SF.

Do we really need another AI newsletter?

I've asked myself this question many times over the past few months. The answer, I've concluded, is probably not. There are already excellent voices covering AI—from researchers to analysts to journalists. And yet, here I am, launching one anyway.

Here's why: we need more *builder* perspectives. Not just analysts dissecting trends from the outside, but practitioners sharing what they're learning from the inside, from the "trenches". After 30 years working for Big Tech, I retired early to become a founder of an AI Agents startup -- going back to my roots, since my PhD topic two decades ago was on multiagent systems. The timing feels right to share what I'm learning on this journey.

## Who Am I?

My name is Michael Maximilien, though most people call me "Max" or "Dr. Max." I'm the founder and CEO of a stealth AI Agents startup here in Silicon Valley.

Before taking the founder leap, I spent my career at IBM, most recently as a Distinguished Engineer leading Open Source teams for AI agents and multiagent systems. My career focused on pioneering software platforms across several technology waves: from early web services, to cloud computing, to containers and serverless, and now to multiagent systems.

A few highlights from that journey:

**Cloud computing pioneer.** I was a key leader in the development of Cloud Foundry, helping establish it as a leading Platform-as-a-Service. In 2014, I became Chief Architect for Cloud Innovations at IBM, and our work contributed to what eventually became the IBM Cloud via Cloud Foundry and Bluemix.

**Serverless and Kubernetes.** I led the IBM open-source team developing Knative, the Kubernetes serverless platform that's now used across the industry.

**Research foundation.** My journey began as a principal engineer at IBM Research Triangle Park, where I conducted pioneering work on semantic Web services. With deep expertise in software engineering and distributed systems, I've published over 100 refereed papers with more than 5,400 citations on Google Scholar and hold 20 issued U.S. patents.

**Academic roots in agents.** My PhD in computer science (2005) -- now 20 years ago—focused on multiagent systems. It's remarkable how long it took for the field to reach mainstream attention, and equally remarkable that I find myself building in this space again.

Today, I'm applying all of that accumulated learning and experience to something new: building an AI Agents company from the ground up. It's the first time I've been a founder, and the experience has been equal parts terrifying and exhilarating.

## Why the Bay Area Matters

I've lived and worked in the Bay Area for twenty years. In that time, I've witnessed the rise and fall of multiple technology waves: Web 2.0, mobile, cloud, crypto, and now AI. Each wave brought its own promises and disappointments, its own winners and casualties.

Through it all, I've stayed deeply connected to the startup, meetup, and open source communities that make this region unique. The informal networks here -- the coffee shop conversations, the dinner party debates, the chance encounters at meetups -- accelerate learning in ways that are hard to replicate elsewhere.

Does location still matter in the age of remote work? For many things, no. But for being at the frontier of a rapidly evolving field like AI Agents? I believe it does. The density of talent, capital, and conversation creates a flywheel that's hard to match.

More on this in a future post -- I have a lot more to say about what makes the Bay Area special (and what doesn't).

## What to Expect from AI Musings

I'm committing to at least two posts per month, published every two weeks. This cadence feels sustainable for depth without sacrificing quality. Some posts will be planned explorations of topics I've been thinking about; others will be reactive commentary on news and developments.

The perspective will be personal, not corporate. I'll share what's working, what's not, and what I'm genuinely uncertain about.

**Content themes will include:**

*AI technology* — Deep dives on agents, coding assistants, vector databases, infrastructure, and the tools that power the AI stack.

*Industry analysis* — Comparisons of tools, observations about companies and trends, and attempts to separate signal from noise.

*Culture and philosophy* — The human side of AI. Meetups and community. The importance of reading, hobbies, and maintaining perspective while building in a fast-moving field.

**For 2026, I have a roadmap already sketched out:**

*January to March* — This introduction, plus posts on AI Coding Assistants, Vector Search for AI Agents, and a retrospective on the AI Agents Meetup SF that I co-founded in 2025.

*March to May* — AI-driven development, hackathons as research platforms, an in-depth comparison of Claude Code vs Cursor vs TRAE, and thoughts on the importance of reading.

*May to June* — What's so special about the Bay Area, AI in education, the importance of hobbies, and selecting the right technology stack.

Plus current events and news as they arise. The field moves fast; the writing will keep pace.

## Why Subscribe?

**For practitioners** — If you're building with AI tools, I'll share practical insights from someone doing the same. What works, what doesn't, and honest assessments of the tools I use daily. No sponsored takes, no sugar-coating.

**For curious technologists** — If you want to understand AI agents without getting lost in hype, I'll offer accessible explanations grounded in decades of context. I've seen enough technology cycles to intuitively know what's real and what's noise.

**For the AI-curious** — If you're interested in AI but don't have a deep technical background, I'll aim to make complex topics approachable. The goal is educated perspective, not gatekeeping.

## A Bit More About Me

Beyond technology, I'm a retired amateur triathlete. I've completed over 10 half-Ironman races, one full Ironman, and more than 20 marathons. While I have not done a triathlon in almost 10 years, the experience and discipline required for endurance sports translates surprisingly well to the marathon of building a startup.

I'm also an award-winning photographer, having received recognition in both 2022 and 2023. Photography teaches you to see—to notice light, composition, the decisive moment. It's a useful counterbalance to the abstract world of software.

You can find me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/drmaximilien) and see the events I host on [Luma](https://luma.com/user/DrMaximilien), including the AI Agents Meetup SF that I co-organize with Dave Nielsen and Alexy Khrabrov.

## Let's Go

This newsletter is a dialogue, not a monologue. I want to hear from you—what topics interest you, what questions you're wrestling with, where you think I'm wrong.

Subscribe if you want perspective from a builder with deep industry experience. Subscribe if you want educated analysis that remains accessible. Subscribe if you want the perspective of a first-time founder navigating the AI revolution after 30 years of preparation.

The next post will dive into AI Coding Assistants—the tools that have genuinely changed how I work, and the ones that haven't lived up to the hype. I've spent the past year testing and using Cursor, Claude Code, TRAE, and others. I have opinions.

Until then, welcome to AI Musings. Let's f****ng go! 🚀
