AI Agents Meetup SF: One Year Retrospective

Target length: ~2000 words

Abstract
* The Bay Area offers ample options for tech meetups and gatherings
* In January 2025, Dave Nielsen and I asked: do we need another AI meetup?
* The answer became clear — 2025 was to be the year of AI Agents and there was no dedicated forum
* We launched AI Agents Meetup SF and ran 9 events in the first year
* Most meetups focused on a specific theme with expert speakers
* This post reflects on what we learned and what's next for 2026

Introduction
* The Bay Area is THE place for AI — like it or not
* Critical mass of companies, talent, Stanford, and Berkeley feeding the ecosystem
* Having been deeply connected in the tech community, I've seen various waves come and go
* First recruited Dave Nielsen — known him 20+ years, watched him lead various Bay Area tech communities
* Dave was also leading IBM's AI Alliance involvement — key connection
* Recruited Alexy Khrabrov — long history leading tech conferences (AI by the Bay)
* Together: the right mix of experience, connections, and passion
